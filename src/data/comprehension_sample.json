        "passage": "Timmy found a small brown puppy near the park last Saturday. The puppy looked tired and hungry. It had no collar around its neck, so Timmy couldn't find out who owned it.\n\nTimmy took the puppy home and showed it to his mother. She said they should make posters to find the owner. Together, they took a photo of the puppy and wrote 'Found: Brown Puppy' on the poster.\n\nThey put up posters all around the neighbourhood. Two days later, a little girl named Sarah came to their house. She was so happy to see her puppy again. She had been looking everywhere for it.\n\nSarah thanked Timmy for taking care of her puppy. As a reward, she invited Timmy to play with the puppy anytime he wanted.",

        "passage": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth. It has no beginning or end – water keeps moving in a circle, changing from one form to another.\n\nThe cycle begins when the sun heats water in oceans, lakes, and rivers. This heat causes the water to evaporate, turning from liquid into water vapour. The vapour rises into the atmosphere, where temperatures are cooler.\n\nAs the water vapour rises higher, it cools down and condenses into tiny water droplets. These droplets gather together to form clouds. When the clouds become too heavy with water, the droplets fall back to Earth as precipitation – rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\nSome of this precipitation flows into rivers and streams, eventually returning to the ocean. Some soaks into the ground, becoming groundwater. Plants absorb this groundwater through their roots and release water vapour through their leaves in a process called transpiration.\n\nThis remarkable cycle has been occurring for billions of years, making life on Earth possible.",

        "passage": "The proliferation of digital technologies has fundamentally transformed how personal information is collected, stored, and utilised. While these advancements have facilitated unprecedented conveniences and efficiencies, they have simultaneously engendered profound concerns regarding individual privacy and data security.\n\nContemporary consumers routinely exchange personal data – often unwittingly – for ostensibly free services. Social media platforms, search engines, and mobile applications harvest vast quantities of user data, constructing detailed behavioural profiles that are subsequently monetised through targeted advertising. This commodification of personal information raises ethical questions about informed consent and the asymmetric power dynamics between corporations and individuals.\n\nGovernments worldwide have responded with varying regulatory frameworks. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes stringent requirements for data protection, including the 'right to be forgotten' and mandatory breach notifications. Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) similarly mandates that organisations obtain consent before collecting personal data and requires them to protect it adequately.\n\nHowever, regulatory measures often lag behind technological innovation. Emerging technologies such as facial recognition, biometric authentication, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices present novel challenges that existing legal frameworks may inadequately address. The tension between technological progress and privacy preservation remains an unresolved dialectic of the digital age.\n\nMoving forward, a multifaceted approach encompassing robust legislation, technological safeguards, and enhanced digital literacy will be essential in navigating this complex landscape.",
